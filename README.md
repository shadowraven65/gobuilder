# gobuilder
A go script to build go scripts... cuz why not  
Simple enough, just a go program that will check the current working directory for a go script and build it for all OS and Arch entries in the buildconfig.json file that is also in the directory.  
You can specify a file if there are multiple go scripts but will still build against all in the json
